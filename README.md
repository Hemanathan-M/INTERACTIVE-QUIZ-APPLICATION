DESCRIPTION
This Interactive Quiz Application is a lightweight, browser-based project designed to test users' knowledge while providing instant feedback and a smooth user experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app showcases essential front-end development skills and is ideal for beginners looking to strengthen their understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content rendering.

The interface is clean and user-friendly. A central container displays the quiz title, the current question, multiple-choice options, and a “Next” button to proceed. Each question is loaded dynamically from a JavaScript array, allowing easy scalability and customization. When a user selects an answer, the app immediately highlights correct and incorrect choices using color-coded feedback—green for correct, red for wrong—enhancing the learning experience.

CONCLUSION
The Interactive Quiz Application is a powerful demonstration of how simple web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—can come together to create an engaging, responsive, and educational experience. Through dynamic question loading, real-time feedback, and score tracking, this project not only reinforces core programming concepts but also emphasizes user experience and interface design.
